# Test-Site

Local site used for testing new features and designs.

With so many new features being discovered for web development, it's hard to keep track of 
all these 'tips and tricks.'  With this, I'll be able to experiment with these new ideas
easily while having access to them in the long run for repurposing usage.  Essentially, 
this is like a codepen but a more cumulative and (relatively) more permanent approach.
